### iSeqQC: An App to perform Quality Controls on expression based NGS data  

#### Introduction to iSeqQC
##### Quality Control (QC) in any high-throughput technology is a critical step, overlooking which can compromise the true conclusion of the data. As mentioned previously by others, a typical RNA-seq analysis should undergo two stages (four steps) of QC:\n 1) Stage 1: Laboratory based- RNA quality, 2) Stag
