## iSeqQC: An App to perform Quality Controls on expression based high-throughput data  

#### Introduction to iSeqQC
Quality Control (QC) in any high-throughput technology is a critical step, overlooking which can compromise the true conclusion of the data. As mentioned previously by others, a typical RNA-seq analysis should undergo two stages (four steps) of QC: 
1) Stage 1: Laboratory based- Step 1: RNA quality
2) Stage 2: Computational based- Step 2: Sequencing quality
                                 Step 3: Mapping quality
                                 Step 4: Batch effects 

Although, several attempts have been made to help researchers to circumvent the errors and biases in their sequencing experiment by developing several tools which detects sequencing and mapping quality (FastQC, picard etc.). The scrutinizing of batch effects in any high-throughput sequencing experiment are often ignored or conducted on limited basis.  

iSeqQC is developed to keep this in mind.
